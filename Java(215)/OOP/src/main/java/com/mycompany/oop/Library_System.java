 2. **Library System**
   - **Problem**: Create a `Library` class that manages books in a library. Each `Book` has attributes like a title, author, and a unique book ID.
     - Add methods to:
       - Add a new book
       - Check out a book (if itâ€™s available)
       - Return a book
       - List all books of a specific genre 
       - Use an array to store all borrowed book IDs and have a method to find out how many books are currently borrowed.
   - **Extra Challenge**: Include a method in the `Book` class to check if the book ID is an *Armstrong number*, which could add a unique identifier for special books in the library.
